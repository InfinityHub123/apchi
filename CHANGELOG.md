# Changelog

What changed between releases, for whoever automates against Apchi's API.

While Apchi is `0.x` a breaking change may land in any minor release, and each one is named
under `## Breaking` below. The contract firms up at 1.0. There is no `/api/v2` planned and no
deprecation window; §19 of `apchi_implementation.md` argues why.

`## Breaking` is the only part of an entry that has to be here. `openapi.json` is the contract
itself and the release notes carry the commit log, so neither is worth repeating.

Two breaks the committed contract cannot show you, and which belong here when they happen:

- Pydantic models reject unknown fields, so a client sending one gets a `422` that no schema
  diff announced.
- A response *value* can move with no schema change. A Client Certificate's
  `valid`/`expiring`/`expired` is recomputed on every read against
  `certificate_expiring_within_days`, so a client branching on it reads a different answer once
  an Admin changes that setting (§13.2).

## Unreleased

## 0.1.1 — 2026-11-02

The first published release, and the baseline this file measures from. The six Sections
through the full lifecycle — stage, review, validate, apply, verify, commit — on both
deployment shapes, with Adoption, three authentication modes, the audit history, and outbound
TLS to all four destinations. Earlier history is the commit log.

Published as `ghcr.io/infinityhub123/apchi:0.1.1` and
`oci://ghcr.io/infinityhub123/charts/apchi` at version and appVersion `0.1.1`.
